# React Todo App With Firebase Back-End
* This is a basic Todo App with React and Firebase (back-end).
* This app is deployed using Firebase hosting.
* You can see the app on this link: https://todo-app-ca8dc.web.app/ and try to mess with it
* You can see the full tutorial about this app on: https://youtu.be/VqgTr-nd7Cg

NOTE: It may be not saving todos while you are checking app out, because I don't have permenant access to firebase database :).
If it's not saving your todos, that's why. Don't worry about the app :).
